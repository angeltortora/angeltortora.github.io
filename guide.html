            <p class="intro__p1">This is a simple, comprehensive guide on building a modern desktop computer.
                Whether it's for gaming, video editing, casual work, or all of the above, this guide will cover
                everything you need to know about starting your new build. Pricing will <b>NOT</b> be included, as
                the value of parts tend to greatly change as time goes on--particularly GPUS (we'll get to that 
                in a moment). I'll try to include estimates to give you a vague idea of how much it might cost,
                but take it with a grain of salt :)
